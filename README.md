In the digital age, excessive screen time has become a growing concern, 
affecting productivity, mental health, and overall well-being. The ATLAS is      
designed to help users manage their digital usage by setting limits on app usage 
and alerting them when they exceed predefined thresholds. 

The "Pause" application is a smart digital wellbeing platform built using 
Flutter and native Android technologies. It is designed to help individuals 
monitor, limit, and ultimately control their screen time habits. By combining real
time app usage tracking with AI-based insights and enforced blocking of 
distracting apps, Pause ensures that users are mindful of their digital behavior. 
The app restricts access to selected apps after user-defined limits are exceeded 
and uses system-level controls to prevent tampering or uninstallation.

The project promotes healthy digital habits through structured time management and active 
screen time regulation. By promoting mindful technology consumption, this 
project aims to reduce digital addiction, improve productivity, and encourage a 
balanced lifestyle in the modern digital era.
